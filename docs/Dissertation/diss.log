[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 Language has evolved and therefore probably gave an evolution
ary advantage to the individuals that exhibited it. As Angelo Cangelosi and Dom
enico Parisi described in a 1998 paper\footnote{\url{https://doi.org/10.1080/09
5400998116512}}, it is difficult to investigate the evolutionary origin of lang
uage and the selective pressures that may have originated language due to the l
imited evidence available. They propose using computer simulations of evolution
ary scenarios to investigate this. In the paper referenced, they describe a sim
ulated toy world where agents controlled by neural-networks interact with an en
vironment of mushrooms that are edible and poisonous. This simulation and the i
deas explored in the paper will be the basis for my project.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 In the paper, Cangelosi and Parisi use small feed-forward neu
ral networks to control the behaviour of each agent. The weights are initially 
random; a genetic algorithm is used to improve the fitness of the species over 
many generations. The agents are also given linguistic abilities; input and out
put nodes of the neural networks produce signals that allow for communication.[

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 By creating three different populations (one without language
, one with an externally imposed language and one with an evolved language) we 
can investigate the evolutionary advantage of language. Furthermore, it allows 
us to investigate a key question posed in the paper: \emph{``Since language req
uires the parallel evolution of linguistic production and linguistic comprehens
ion, how can language evolve when it has a purely informative function and ther
efore it is advantageous to the receiver but not the producer?''}[]

watch the life of one agent within the simulation. This would involve rendering
 a simple 2D world with textures for the agents and mushrooms. This could be ex

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 In a 2000 paper\footnote{\url{http://cogprints.org/2036/}}, C
angelosi and Harnad use a similar same toy world of mushrooms and foragers to p
lace two ways of acquiring categories in direct competition with each other. Th
ey compare ``sensorimotor toil'' (where categories are acquired through real-ti
me, feedback-correct, trial and error experience) to ``symbolic theft'' (where 
new categories are acquired by hearsay from boolean combinations of symbols \em
ph{describing} them). They find that the origins of natural language could be e
xplained by the apparent infinitely superiority of a hybrid symbolic/sensorimot
or combination compared to purely sensorimotor precursors.[]
